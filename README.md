# epistasis-study
This repository contains the complete computational workflow used in the study  
“Demographic context shapes epistatic interactions and adaptive potential in SARS-CoV-2”,  
submitted to PLOS Computational Biology.

All scripts are written in Python (v3.12.4) and R (v4.5.0):
1. random_sampling_SARS-CoV-2.py
2. trim_fasta.py
3. filter_N_content.py
4. remove_stop_codons.py
5. mutual_info_parallel_epistasis.py
6. table_positively_selected_sites.py
7. plotting.R

Due to GISAID data-sharing restrictions, raw sequences and metadata are not included. However, the structure and input format are provided to enable other researchers to reproduce the workflow with their own datasets.
